_Post Mortem._

This post is only to remember the milestone of my very first website, which was published online in 2008.

It was called rdcarva.net, and it was supposed to be a blog about "Technology, Lifestyle and Electronic Music". It was built with Drupal and that beautiful Garland theme.

Good old times.
